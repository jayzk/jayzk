## Hi there, I'm Jayden! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a versatile developer with experience in both front-end and back-end technologies. I have a strong background in designing and implementing database structures using technologies like SQLite and MongoDB. 
My knowledge of MVC architecture and RESTful API development helps me create scalable and maintainable systems. I am also skilled in creating intuitive user interfaces using popular frameworks like React, along with various CSS frameworks. Additionally, Iâ€™m proficient in using version control systems such as Git, ensuring smooth collaboration and code management.
